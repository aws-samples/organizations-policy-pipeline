## ERROR: Missing Pipeline Logs

**No Terraform logs were provided for analysis.**

The `<Pipeline Logs>` section contains only "oi" which appears to be a typo or placeholder text.

### Required Information:
To perform the security analysis, please provide:
- Terraform plan/apply output showing resource changes
- Indicators of policy modifications (+, -, ~)
- Changes to `scp-management.json` file
- Policy statement differences

### What I Need to See:
```
Example format:
~ aws_organizations_policy.example
  - content: {...old policy...}
  + content: {...new policy...}
  
+ aws_organizations_policy_attachment.new
  policy_id: "p-xxxxx"
  target_id: "ou-xxxxx"
```

**Please resubmit with complete Terraform pipeline logs for security review.**
